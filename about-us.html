                    <h2>History</h2>
                    <p>In 2015, Emily Thompson was looking for pet sitting care for her two small pomeranian princesses.
                        While on her search, she noticed how difficult it was to find a service she could entrust her
                        darlings with. This is all how Furry Friends Daycare came to be. What began as a small,
                        passionate venture has blossomed into a trusted community staple, providing unparalleled care to
                        pets and peace of mind to their owners. Our journey has always been guided by a simple yet
                        profound mission: to bring peace to pet owners, one tail wag at a time. Over the years, our team
                        providing our platform has expanded to include services, features and options to our customers,
                        always while prioritizing the well-being and happiness of the pets in our care.</p>
